# Genuary 2025

[Genuary](https://genuary.art/) is a challenge where every day of January you write some code to generate something creative based on a prompt.

## Here are some of my creations:

- Day 1: [Time grid](https://gistpreview.github.io/?28a2503fe5b0f2ff37990d31974f2531)
    - Prompt: Vertical or horizontal lines only.
